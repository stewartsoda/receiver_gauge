
drawPage()
    This method draws all the gauges on the page
    Reads the page config table
    Calls drawGauge() for each gauge
    If printFPS
        it prints the FPS in little text in the bottom left corner
    Exits

drawGauge()
    This method draws an individual gauge
    Takes a pointer to a gaugeConfig
    if pageNeedsSetup flag is set
        it sets up the gauge, drawing on the screen
        it blanks the gauge area
        it draws the outline boxes of the gauge bar
            it draws a white outline box from limits[0] to limits[1]
            it draws a red outline box from limits[1] to limits[2]
            it draws a black fill box from limits[0] to limits[2]
            gauge bar should look like this:
                white   |   red
                ---------------
                ---------------
        it draws the gauge label
        it draws the gauge limits
    it blanks the gaugeCanvas
    it draws a fill box from limits[0] to value on the gaugeCanvas
    it draws value in the digitsCanvas
    if value >= limits[1]
        drawColor is red
    else
        drawColor is white
    it pastes the gaugeCanvas
    it pastes the digitsCanvas
    Exits

How to hold the page layout?
    
    


gaugeConfig
    Needs to hold data about
    byte[2] origin - Origin (upper left) coordinate: origin[0] = x,  origin[1] = y
    byte[2] dimensions - Dimensions of the gauge: dimensions[0] = width, dimensions[1] = height
    bool vert - is the gauge vertical, or horizontal
    char[] label - label of gauge
    int[3] limits - limits of gauge: limits[0] = min, limits[1] = warn, limits[2] = max
    int value - current value of gauge
